/**
 * @agi/db-schema — unified drizzle schema for agi_data Postgres database.
 *
 * Single source of truth for all AGI platform services + Local-ID. Every table
 * lives in the `public` schema. Service-area prefixes (`hf_*`, `plugins_*`,
 * `mapps_*`) group related tables; core concepts (entities, users, coa_chains,
 * etc.) go unprefixed.
 *
 * Per memory `feedback_single_source_of_truth_db` — NEVER create a second
 * database or a subschema. When a new service needs tables, add them here.
